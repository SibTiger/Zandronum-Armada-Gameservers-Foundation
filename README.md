# Zandronum Armada Gameservers Foundation
The _Armada Foundation_ is a small collection of configuration files that might be helpful for those that want to setup a collection of game servers in __Zandronum__ or __SkullTag__ port branches. These configuration files houses most of the current Console Variables that are available in Zandronum, but the goal of these configuration files is to try to give the game server maintainer the possibility to make game servers as quickly and painlessly as plausible. This is accomplished by separating what _Console Variables_ that would be manipulated the most within general individual game servers and keeping other Console Variables into a more centralized but global region. For example, Voodoo doll configurations can be done within the global scope of the configuration files, where as - game modes and how many users can connect to a game server can be done individually. I hope others will find some good use for these server configuration sets.
